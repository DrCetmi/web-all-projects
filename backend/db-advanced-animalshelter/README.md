# Animal shelter

This is a full stack animal shelter application. There are two frontend files; `index.html` and `admin.html` - both are meant to be run using VS Code Live Server.

Your tasks are to create the API for managing the animals and extend the existing frontend code to make it work. This task is intentionally difficult and requires you to read the code and think about the application. You can do it!

## Requirements

- Investigate the existing code and work with it
- Endpoints required

    - `GET /animal` - return all animals
    - `POST /animal` - create new animal
    - `PUT /animal/:id` - update an animal
    - `PATCH /animal/:id` - update an animal
    - `DELETE /animal/:id` - remove an animal
